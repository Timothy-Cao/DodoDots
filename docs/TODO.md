# DodoDots — TODO

Prioritized backlog. **When working a task, move it to "In Progress"; when done, mark `[x]` and leave dated.** Keep this file fresh — it's the next agent's memory.

Format: `[ ] TITLE` (one-liner) → **Why** (short rationale) → **How** (sketch). If blocked, add `BLOCKED: reason`.

## P0 — Next session should start here

### Gameplay feel

- [x] 2026-04-20 — **Add SFX** — zero-asset Web Audio API synth in `lib/sfx.ts`: latch, traverse, complete (element hits 0), win (C-E-G chord), fail, undo, invalid. Wired into `gameStore.dispatch` and `undo`. AudioContext unlocked on first pointerdown in GameScreen.
- [x] 2026-04-20 — **First-play onboarding hint** — `<FirstPlayHint>` pill fades after 4.5s or first pointerdown; gated on `dododots:hasPlayed` in localStorage.
- [x] 2026-04-20 — **Background grid pattern** — full-viewport CSS grid on `html` element (40px, 5% alpha cyan lines). SVG `<pattern>` rect removed; CSS is single source of truth.

### Interaction polish

- [x] 2026-04-20 — **Pointer cursor on eligible starts** — hit-target circle sets cursor:pointer for clickable nodes, cursor:default for locked/unreachable.
- [x] 2026-04-20 — **Disable text selection in gameplay area** — `user-select:none` + `-webkit-user-select:none` on `body` in globals.css.
- [x] 2026-04-20 — **Trackpad/touch support** — switched to `onPointerMove`/`onPointerLeave` on GameBoard; touch skips snap preview (finger occlusion). Nodes use `onPointerDown` hit targets.

### Content

- [x] 2026-04-20 — **Main menu at `/`** — minimal Tron-styled menu with Daily, Tutorial, and disabled stubs for Campaign and Builder.

---

## P1 — Soon, before community content

### Builder + persistence (big)

- [ ] **Level builder** — see Phase 11 of the implementation plan. Supabase schema + auth + RPCs are already specified.
- [x] 2026-04-20 — **Tutorial** — `/tutorial` route with 4 hand-authored levels (click, path, revisit, think-ahead). Caption bar + Next/Finish progression. Solvability verified in `lib/__tests__/tutorial.test.ts`.

### Quality / smoothness

- [ ] **Undo visual feedback** — when you press `Z`, briefly flash the "undone" node/edge in cyan so the player sees what happened.
- [ ] **Redo (`Shift+Z` or `Y`)** — if we tracked history, we can trivially track a redo stack too.
- [ ] **Graph fit-to-viewport.** Right now the SVG viewBox is 0–100 and nodes live in 0.1–0.9. If a puzzle happens to cluster to one corner (generator edge case), wasted space is ugly. Auto-pan/zoom or tighter bounding.
- [ ] **Puzzle thumbnail on win overlay** — show the solved graph inline under "SOLVED" instead of just the text. Great for screenshots/sharing.

### Generator quality

- [ ] **Reject trivial puzzles.** If the walk is shorter than 6 steps, generate a different seed offset. Players don't want a 2-move "daily."
- [ ] **Difficulty tiers** — internal category (easy/med/hard) derived from nodeCount × walk-complexity. Expose as a ★ rating on the HUD.
- [ ] **Seed offset for bad seeds** — if the walk stalls (early termination due to caps) and the result is too short, increment seed and retry.

---

## P2 — Nice to have

### Visual

- [ ] **Dim visited edges slightly more** once both endpoints are done. Right now they stay green; they could fade to a muted green to let unfinished regions pop.
- [ ] **Subtle particle layer** behind the graph. Few drifting dots. Adds life without noise.
- [ ] **Smooth transform on graph reflow** when the viewport resizes. Small touch; currently it just snaps.
- [ ] **Win-cascade direction hint** — the wave should visibly originate from the *last node clicked* (it already does, but strengthen the motion so players register it).

### UX

- [ ] **Best-score tracking** per daily date. Store in `dailyCompletions` (`bestMoves` field). Show "Your best: N" on re-play.
- [x] 2026-04-20 — **Share result** — `lib/share.ts` with Web Share API + clipboard fallback. Star rating (1–4 stars based on moves/par ratio). Share button on daily win overlay, inline 'Copied!' feedback for clipboard path.
- [x] 2026-04-20 — **Streak counter** — `storage.getStreak` / `updateStreakOnSolve`. `<StreakBadge>` on main menu (hidden when streak=0). 30-day `<SolvedCalendar>` grid also on main menu.
- [ ] **Keyboard shortcut legend** — small `?` button in HUD that shows `R, Z, Esc` list on hover.

### Accessibility

- [ ] **Colorblind safe mode.** Current green/red/grey is probably problematic for deuteranopia. Add a toggle to shift green → cyan-white, red → orange-white.
- [ ] **Reduced motion support** — `@media (prefers-reduced-motion)` to disable pulses and win cascade.
- [ ] **Keyboard-only navigation** — arrow keys to move between nodes + enter to click. For accessibility and power users.

### Dead code / cleanup

- [x] 2026-04-19 — ~~Delete `components/game/Comet.tsx`~~ — already removed in polish pass.
- [x] 2026-04-19 — ~~Audit `stores/gameStore.ts` for leftover anim/queued state~~ — verified clean.
- [ ] **CSS animations in `globals.css` are accumulating** — consider splitting into `styles/animations.css` when it grows past ~40 lines.

---

## P3 — Research / long tail

- [ ] **Directional edges in generator** — once the builder allows them, teach the generator to use them sparingly for variety.
- [ ] **Edge curvature when two nodes share multiple edges.** Current rendering overlaps them into a single line visually.
- [ ] **Solve-hint mode** — shows the next step. Locked unless the player requests it. Affects score.
- [ ] **Campaign structure** — decide: linear unlock, world map, or free select?
- [ ] **Community level moderation** — once publishing exists, how do we handle spam/inappropriate content?
- [ ] **Procedural campaign** — can the generator produce a sequence of increasing-difficulty puzzles with curriculum? (Might replace hand-authored campaign entirely.)
- [x] 2026-04-20 — **Mobile UX pass** — viewport meta, safe-area CSS, touch-action:none on SVG, 44pt hit targets on nodes, haptic vibrate(8ms) on traverse, ActionBar (Undo/Reset/Menu), responsive HUD with clamp(), 48px overlay buttons.

## Investigation / verification needed

See [QA.md](QA.md) for the full check list. Summary of what to verify before a production push:

- [ ] Click + snap on small viewports (375px wide mobile)
- [ ] Windows Chrome / Firefox / Safari compatibility (SVG filters have known flakes)
- [ ] Performance on 20+ node puzzles (builder can create these)
- [ ] Keyboard layouts: AZERTY, Dvorak — does `R`/`Z` still feel natural?
- [ ] Does the commit-ring animation cause repaint lag on low-end hardware?
- [ ] Seeded PRNG determinism across Node / browser / different builds

---
